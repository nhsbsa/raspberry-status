Status board bootstrap for raspberry devices

# Initial setup
## Creating the Operating System
### Formatting an SD Card
Format a SD card using a tool as recommended here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sdxc_formatting.md

No additional special options need to be selected - like boot markers.

### Download an Operating System
1. Get the latest version of NOOBS - not NOOBS lite
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/

2. Unzip to your workstation first.
3. Copy the contents onto the root of the formatted SD card. You'll have folders such as "OS" on the root.
4. Eject the SD card safely before pulling it out of the workstation.

## Booting the Raspberry
1. Insert the SD card fully into the Raspberry.
2. Connect the monitor, keyboard and mouse before inserting and turning on the power.
